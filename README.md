# MunchkinBot

An IRC bot to help play Munchkin. Much of the game is going to be left off, as it is more fun as a dialogue than automated. This will have some basic state tracking (level tracking and turn cycle tracking), a card manager (with provisions for taking in a JSON file with cards; sorry, that'd put me on much more thin ice, copyright-speaking), and some other stuff as I see fit. 


# On Copyright

If I'm asked to take it down by Steve Jackson Games, I will comply as soon as is possible. I claim no copyright whatsoever over the game or its contents.
